### Project Ideas
We are seeking proposals for projects that contribute to Processing, p5.js, Processing.py, Processing for Android, and other potential initiatives related to the core mission of the Processing Foundation.  You do not need to propose something from this list, we are looking for your new ideas. However, if you are searching for ideas, here are some links to get you started:
* General website - for processing.org, p5js.org, py.processing.org, we need HTML/CSS design work as well as assistance in updating and incorporating new tutorials.
* Processing Foundation project list: https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List
* Processing Fellowship ideas list: https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Processing-Fellowships
* Current fellowships: https://processingfoundation.org/fellowships
* GSoC 2015: https://github.com/shiffman/GSOC-2015-Report/blob/gh-pages/report.md

The Processing Foundation is excited to announce summer internships for 2016. Projects can range from exploratory research and software development, documentation and education work, as well as community outreach initiatives that diversify the Processing audience, specifically addressing issues of gender, racial, income, and/or ability barriers. 

Applicants are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the Processing Foundation project list wiki, current fellowships, past GSoC work, and to envision how their projects might extend beyond the Foundation’s support. The internships support the Foundation’s mission of empowerment by emphasizing learning as part of the process of proposed projects. We encourage proposals that involve the intern’s self-sustained investigations into what they may not have known before. This can be initiated at any level of expertise, and we are open to applicants from all backgrounds and skill levels.

Interns will be selected by the Processing Foundation’s Board of Directors in discussion with ITP faculty and staff. The Processing Foundation will work to together with each intern to find appropriate mentorship for the project, and provide feedback and support. Interns will be hired as NYU employees at a rate of $20/hour for a total of 200 hours (totaling $4000 USD), to begin as early as May 23, 2016 and to be completed by August 15, 2016

Application deadline is 5pm Monday, April 11th.  Selected interns will be notified by Monday, April 25, 2016. Late applications will not be accepted.
