Command line support is now available for Java mode.

-   On Windows and Linux, use the processing-java program that's in the
    download.
-   On Mac OS X, there's an option in the Tools menu to install the
    command line tool.

For information about how to use command line mode, type
"processing-java --help" into the console.

### Notes

-   On Mac OS X, you may need to reinstall the command line tool after
    downloading a new version of Processing.

-   Build and export options should even work in headless mode when
    enabled. No guarantees, but simple test results were promising. If
    you run into trouble, please let us know by posting a bug report.
    Note that even though the compiler can run in headless mode,
    Processing sketches still cannot.
