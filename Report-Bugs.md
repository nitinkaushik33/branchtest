If you spot a problem with Processing, please let us know. Follow the steps below to increase the chances of a quick resolution. (Our contributors are almost entirely volunteers. Help us help you!)



## 1. Is it a problem or a question?

For *questions* about how to use Processing, please post to [forum.processing.org](http://forum.processing.org).

*Problems* (not *questions!*) with the software or website can be reported as GitHub issues. *Problems* include:

- bugs (or probable bugs) with the Processing software
- typos or other mistakes in the [Reference](https://processing.org/reference/) or elsewhere on the website

If you create a new issue that’s really just a clarifying question about how to use Processing, we’ll close it and nicely ask you to visit the forum. Ideas or suggestions for *enhancements* should be posted on the forum. When in doubt, start by posting on the [forum](http://forum.processing.org).

Did I mention the [forum](http://forum.processing.org)?



## 2. Choose where to report the issue.

The Processing source is spread across several [[repositories | Repositories]]; choose the most appropriate place to report the issue, so we don’t have to ask you (nicely) to move it later.

[processing/processing-**docs**](https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues)  
- the website, [processing.org](https://processing.org)
- the [Reference](https://processing.org/reference/) pages
- Built-in examples

[processing/**processing**](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues)  
- the Processing software itself, including:
  - the Processing language (API)
  - the Processing IDE (for Mac, Windows, or Linux)
  - any Processing renderers

[processing/processing-**video**](https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues)  
- the built-in Video library

[processing/processing-**sound**](https://github.com/processing/processing-sound/issues)  
- the built-in Sound library

[processing/processing-**android**](https://github.com/processing/processing-android/issues)  
- the Android mode

[processing/processing-**library-template**](https://github.com/processing/processing-library-template/issues)  
- the template for building and generating Processing libraries

[processing/processing-**forum**](https://github.com/processing/processing-forum/issues)  
- the code that powers the aforementioned [forum](http://forum.processing.org/)

[jdf/**processing.py**](https://github.com/jdf/processing.py)  
- the Python mode

[kazimuth/**processing-py-site**](https://github.com/kazimuth/processing-py-site)  
- the Python mode’s documentation and website, [py.processing.org](http://py.processing.org)

If none of the above feel like a great fit, explore the full list of [[repositories | Repositories]] and find a better place.

Make sure the problem has to do with Processing and not one of the many third-party contributions, such as libraries, modes, tools, or examples.



## 3. Write helpfully.

To write an effective issue report:

- Be precise
- Be clear
- Explain the steps required to reproduce the bug
- Cite your OS and version, and which version of Processing you’re using
- If reporting an issue on the website, include the URL where the problem is
- Screenshots are super helpful! They let us see what you see. You can drag images directly onto the issue text to upload them.
- Errors are super helpful! (Sometimes.) Copy and paste any errors into the issue.
- Include only one bug per report
- Separate fact from speculation

No bug is too trivial to report, as small bugs may hide big bugs.

Please do not report bugs on the forum; they will be deleted.
